Remove all the placeholder content and fill your blog with you.

## Customize your About Page

- Open `pages/about.md`
- Write a short bio about yourself as a new software developer

## Remove the Placeholder Content

We won't delete this yet, so you can look back on it for a reference.

- Rename `posts/example.md` to `posts/example.md.old`
- Rename `posts/hello.md` to `posts/hello.md.old`
- Rename `pages/showcase.md` to `pages/showcase.md.old`

Later, when you no longer need a reference, you can delete these files.
