  // Gatsby useStaticQuery offers essentially no benefit:
  // - The data is already static data (just in another file) 
  // - A reference to the static data with a rollup process would easily include it:
  // - It isn't possible to pass any variables, so that has no gain
  //   - Since this is limited to non-parameter data, it is nothing really
  // - Calling whatever method to get the data would cache it just the same
  // - The only possible benefit would be to cache the data (so it isn't re-calculated each render, but that is easy to do with memoization if actually desired)
  //   - And without that, it is possible to refresh the data at runtime even with the cached build time copy (which isn't possible with static)
  // - Using a parameter based call could be cached at build time according to context without a problem

  // A Store Module Version that does everything useStaticQuery does, but simple (no complex graphql, no registration, all typed, all in one place, but not forced to be in one place, could be anything really)
