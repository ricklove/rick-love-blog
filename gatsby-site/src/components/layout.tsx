  // This offers essentially no benefit.
  // - The data is already static data (just in another file) 
  // - A reference to the static data with a rollup process would easily include it:
  // - It isn't possible to pass any variables, so that has no gain
  //   - Since this is limited to non-parameter data, it is nothing really
  // - Calling whatever method to get the data would cache it just the same
  // - The only possible benefit would be to cache the data (so it isn't re-calculated each render, but that is easy to do with memoization if actually desired)
  //   - And without that, it is possible to refresh the data at runtime even with the cached build time copy (which isn't possible with static)
  // - Using a parameter based call could be cached at build time according to context without a problem
